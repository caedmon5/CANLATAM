Thank you for a wonderful Open and Inclusive Access to Research Symposium (OIAR)! Nearly 1700 people registered for the conference, and many sessions had 200 or more attendees. We had excellent speakers from South America, North America, and Europe. Talks were given in Spanish and in English.

The conference mailing list oiar-l@uleth.ca has over 1700 members, all of whom are interested in Open Access and Open Science.
