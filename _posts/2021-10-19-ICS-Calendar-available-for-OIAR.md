An [ICS (calendar) file](http://openandinclusiveresearch.org/assets/img/OIAR.ics) is  for [_Open and Inclusive Access to Research_]. You can use this to add all OIAR events to your calendar for the week. We will update the ICS file in the event of changes.

Note that you also must register (free) for the event using this link: [https://uleth.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAvfuitrDgsGt2YsmayUhSJvZMWBp9Qwsha](https://uleth.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJAvfuitrDgsGt2YsmayUhSJvZMWBp9Qwsha)

After you have registered you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.
